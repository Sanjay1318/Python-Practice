HOW TO IDENTIFY  PATTERN LOGIC

Trick 1: Break question into parts
    Example: pyramid
    Ask → Do I need spaces? stars? numbers? both?

Trick 2: Outer loop → Rows
    Inner loop → What repeats in row
        
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(...):

Trick 3: For number/string problems
    Think:
        Extract digit?
        Reverse?
        Compare?
        Loop until number becomes 0?

Trick 4: Recognize Common “Templates”
    Fibonacci → previous 2 sum
    Palindrome → reverse check
    Prime → check divisibility
    Pattern → nested loops
    Factorial → multiplication loop
